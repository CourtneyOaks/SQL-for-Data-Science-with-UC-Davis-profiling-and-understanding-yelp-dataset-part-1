# Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Understanding (Part 1)

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
* i. Attribute table = 10000
* ii. Business table = 10000
* iii. Category table = 10000
* iv. Checkin table = 10000
* v. elite_years table = 10000
* vi. friend table =  10000
* vii. hours table = 10000
* viii. photo table =  10000
* ix. review table =  10000
* x. tip table =  10000
* xi. user table = 10000

SQL code used to arrive at answer:
* Attribute table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as attribute_rows
FROM attribute
* Business table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as business_rows
FROM business
* Category table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as category_rows
FROM category
* Checkin table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as checkin_rows
FROM checkin
* Elite years table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as eliteyears_rows
FROM elite_years
* Friend table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as friend_rows
FROM friend
* Hours table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as hours_rows
FROM hours
* Photo table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as photo_rows
FROM photo
* Review table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as review_rows
FROM review
* Tip table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as tip_rows
FROM tip
* User table:
SELECT 
COUNT (*) as user_rows
FROM user

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
* i. Business = 10000 records for id
* ii. Hours = 1562 records for business_id
* iii. Category = 2643 records for business_id
* iv. Attribute = 1115 records for business_id
* v. Review = 10000 records for id and 8090 records for business_id
* vi. Checkin = 493 records for business_id
* vii. Photo = 10000 records for id and 6493 records for business_id
* viii. Tip = 537 records for user_id and 3979 records for business id
* ix. User = 10000 records for id
* x. Friend = 11 records for user id
* xi. Elite_years = 2780 records for user id

SQL code used to arrive at answer:
* Business:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM business
* Hours:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM hours
* Category:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM category
* Attribute:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM attribute
* Review:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM review
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM review
* Checkin:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM checkin
* Photo: 
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM photo
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM photo
* Tip:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM tip
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT business_id)
FROM tip
* User:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM user
* Friend:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM friend
* Elite years:
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_id)
FROM elite_years
